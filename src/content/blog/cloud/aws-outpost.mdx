- Used to create hybrid cloud.
- Hybrid Cloud: Businesses that keep an on-premise infrastructure along with a cloud infrastructure.
- Therefore, there are 2 ways of dealing with an IT System:

One, for the AWS Cloud (Using AWS Console, CLI,AWS,API)
and Second, for their on-prem infrastructure.

AWS Outposts are "Server Racks" that offer the same AWS infrastructure, service, API, & tools, to build your own Application on-premise
just as in the cloud.

AWS will setup & manage "Outpost Racks"
Within your on-prem infrastructure, and you can start leveraging AWS services on-premise.
