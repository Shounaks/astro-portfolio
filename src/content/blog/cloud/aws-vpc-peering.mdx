Connect 2 VPC, privately using AWS network and make them behave as if they were in same network.
Note: The VPC's joined in this way must not have an overlapping CIDR (IP Address Range).

- VPC Peering is not Translative: <br/>
meaning: If you connect to "VPC-A" to "VPC-B" and another peering between "VPC-A" & "VPC-C" even then
"VPC-B" & "VPC-C" cannot talk to each other! To Do that you need to add VPC peering between "Subnet-B" & "Subnet-C".
