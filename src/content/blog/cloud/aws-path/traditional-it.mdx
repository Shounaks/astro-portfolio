Before we delve deep into Cloud Computing, we need to discuss what niche it fulfills.

Traditional computing, also known as on-premises computing, means you have physical servers and hardware at your workplace. You buy and maintain this equipment, and you need IT experts to set it up and keep it running.

<div>
	<Question link="what-does-the-server-composes-of" question="What Does the Server Composes of?" />
	<div class="list-disc pl-6">
		<li>Compute: CPU</li>
		<li>Memory: RAM</li>
		<li>Storage: HDD / SSD</li>
		<li>Database: Store data in a structured manner</li>
		<li>Network: Router, Switches, DNS Server</li>
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<Question
		link="problems-with-traditional-it"
		question="What are the problems encountered by traditional IT?"
	/>
	<div class="list-disc pl-6">
		<li>We pay for the rent of "Data Centers".</li>
		<li>We pay for Power Supply,Cooling & Maintainence.</li>
		<li>Adding and Replacing of Hardware takes time.</li>
		<li>Scaling is limited to the amount of servers we have at the location.</li>
		<li>Hire 24x7 team to monitor infrastructure.</li>
		<li>How to deal with disasters? (earthquake,power shutdown, fire,etc.)</li>
	</div>
</div>

<br />
We take all the risk, hence there was a requirement to externalize all of this. Cloud
Service Providers, or CSP in short fill the gap between infrastructure and software
requirement:
<div class="pl-6">
	<li>They provide access to servers.</li>
	<li>They hire and manage staff to monitor the same.</li>
	<li>They pay for all the real estate, power supply and all other CAPEX*.</li>
	<li>We are only responsible for configuration of the cloud.</li>
</div>

<div class="pl-6">
	CAPEX == Capital Expenditure
	
	CapEx is the spending of money on physical infrastructure upfront and then deducting that expense from your tax bill over time. CapEx is an upfront cost, which has a value that reduces over time and usually has no recurring cost.
