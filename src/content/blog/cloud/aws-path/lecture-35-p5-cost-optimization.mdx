- Adopt a consumption mode: Pay only for what you use.
- Measure overall efficiency: Use CloudWatch
- Stop spending money on data-center operations:
    AWS does the infrastructure part and enable customer to focus on Organisation projects.
- Analyze and Attribute expenditure:

    - As managed services operate at cloud scale, they can offer a lower cost per transaction or service.
