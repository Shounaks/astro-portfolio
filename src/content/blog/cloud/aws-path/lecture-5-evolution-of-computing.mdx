import Section from "../../../../components/Section.astro";

<Section link="dedicated-hosts" title="1️⃣ Dedicated Hosts"/>
A physical server wholely utilized by a single customer. 
You have to guess your capacity and need to overpay for underutilize servers.
You cant vertically scale and need manual migration.
Replacing a server is very difficult.
Multiple apps can result in conflicts in resource sharing.

BUT!!
You have a gurantee of security privacy & full utility of underlaying resources.

<Section link="virtual-machines" title="2️⃣Virtual Machines"/>
We can run multiple VM on one machine. Hypervisor is the software that handles/manages the VM Guest Operating Systems.
Physical Server Shared by multiple customer.
You need to pay a fraction of Capital Expenditure as compared to [🔗Dedicated Hosts](#dedicated-hosts).
You still will overpay for underutilized VM.

NOTE #1 : Multiple Applications on Same VM will cause conflicts in resource sharing. But It is much easier to export/import images for migration

NOTE #2 : Easier to vertically and horizontally scale.

<Section link="docker-container" title="3️⃣ Docker Containers"/>
VM running multiple containers.
Docker Daemon is the name of the software layer that lets you run multiple containers
You can maximize the utility of available capacity, which is more cost-effective, than multiple VMs.
Multiple apps can run side-by-side without being limited to some OS requirement & will not cause conflicts during resource sharing.

<Section link="serverless-functions" title="4️⃣ Serverless Functions"/>
They are managed VM running managed containers. 
You upload a piece of code.
You are responsible to select the amount of memory, duration and the type of runtype.
Only responsible for Code + Data.
Very Cost Effective, only pay for the time the code is running.
NOTE: <mark>Cold Start</mark> is a side-efffect of serverless.
