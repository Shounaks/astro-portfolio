```markdown
- Scalable: Vertically & Horizontally
- Disposable Resources: Server should be Disposable and easily configurable.
- Automation: Serverless, Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Scaling ...
- Loose Coupling: 
    - Monoliths are applications that do more and more over time. i.e. they become bigger and bigger.
    - We need to break this monolith down into smaller components.
    - A change/failure in one components should not cascade to other components.
- Services not servers:
    - Dont just use EC2
    - Use managed services, Databases, Serverless, etc.
