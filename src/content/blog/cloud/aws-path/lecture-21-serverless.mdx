- Serverless is a new paradigm in which thedeveloper do not have to manage servers anymore.
- They just Deploy Code!
- Or they just Deploy Functions!

<br />

Initially Serverless was interchangably called Function as a Service (FaaS), since this paradigm was first pioneered by AWS Lambda, but now
it also includes anything that's managed like Databases, Messaging, Storage, etc. It is to be noted that Serverless does not mean that there
are no servers, but rather it means that you just dont manage or provision or notice them while using the services!

Examples of AWS Serverless Services:

- Amazon S3
- Amazon DynamoDB
- Amazon Fargate
- Amazon Lambda
