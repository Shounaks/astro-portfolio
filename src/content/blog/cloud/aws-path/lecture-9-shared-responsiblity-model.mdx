Nothing much to learn here, just know what items you are responsible for and what items AWS is responsible for.

Customer Data is your responsiblity.
same is platform, IA, Application config
OS, NEtwork, Firewall Setup is on your head.
Security of ClientSide Data + Security of Server Side Data + Security of data in transit is also something you need to take care of.
<hr/>
all other items are taken care of by AWS.
