<span class="text-emerald-400"> Security Groups</span>
- Operates at instance level
- Supports ALLOW rules only
- Is Stateful: return traffic is allowed automatically regardless of any rules.
- We evaluate all the rules before deciding wheather to allow traffic.
- Applies to an instance only if someone specifies the security group while launching an instance. or attaching security group with instance later on.

<span class="text-emerald-400"> Network ACL</span>
- Operates at subnet level
- Supports ALLOW & DENY rules
- Is Stateless: Return traffic must be explicitly allowed by rules.
- We process rules in number order.
- Automatically Applies to all instance in a subnet, its associated with, (you dont have to rely on users to specify security group)
