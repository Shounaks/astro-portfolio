<Section link="regional-service" title="Regional Service" />
AWS Scopes the AWS management console on a selected region. This will determine when
an AWS service will be launched and what will be seen in the AWS service console.
You generally dont select the region for a service at the time of creation.

<Section link="global-service" title="Global Service" />
Some AWS services operate across multiple regions & the region will be fixed to "Global".{" "}
