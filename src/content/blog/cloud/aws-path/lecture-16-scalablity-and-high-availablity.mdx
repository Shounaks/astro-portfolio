<Section link="introduction" title="What is Scalability & High Availablty?" />
<br />

- Scalability means application can handle greater loads by adapting.
- There are 2 kinds of Stablity:
- <mark>Vertical Scalability</mark> : There is a hardware limit to this.
- <mark>Horizontal Scalability</mark> : same as "Elasticity".
- Scaliblity is linked but different to High Availablity.
- The goal of High Availablity is to survive a datacenter loss (disaster).

| -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| Ability to accomodate larger load either by making hardware stronger (scale up) or adding nodes (scale out). |

| Once a system is scalable, elasticity means there will be some auto-scaling, so that system can be scaled based on load |
