The ability of a system recover from infrastructure or service desruption,
and dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand & migrate desruptions
such as misconfiguration or transient network issues.

<Section link="design-principles" title="Design Principles" /> 
```markdown
- Test "Recovery Procedure" : 
    Use automation to simulate different failures or recreate scenarios that led to failovers before.
- Automatically Recover from failure : 
    Anticipate & remidiate failures before they occur.
- Scale Horizontally to increase Aggregate System Availablity:
    Distribute Request across multiple smaller resources to ensure that they dont share a common point of failure.
- Stop Guessing Capacity:
    Maintain the optimal level to satisfy demand without over/under provisioning it. i.e. Use AutoScaling
- Manage Change in Automation: Use Automation to make changes to infrastructure.
