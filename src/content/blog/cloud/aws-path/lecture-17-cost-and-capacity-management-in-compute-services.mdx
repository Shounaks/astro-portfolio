Cost Management tackles the question of "how to save money?", while Capacity
Management answers "How do we meet the demand of traffic & usage through
adding/upgrading services?".

One way to save on compute services is by paying up in full or partially(Saving Plan),
or by commiting to yearly contracts (RI), or by being flexible about availablity
and interruptions to compute services (spot instances).
