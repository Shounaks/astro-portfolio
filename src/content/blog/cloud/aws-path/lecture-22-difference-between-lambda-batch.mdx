Following are the points which differentiate between 2 services.

<Section link="lambda-points" title="Lambda" />

- Time Limit (in which task should be processed)
- Limited Runtime (Programming Language) Options (as compared to AWS Batch)
- Limited Temporary disk space.
- Serverless

<Section link="batch-points" title="Batch" />
- No Time Limit
- Any runtime as long as it's packaged as docker image.
- Rely on EBS/Instance Store for disk space.
- Relies on EC2. (Spot Instance or dedicated.. whatever..)
