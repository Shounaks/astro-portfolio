Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources
through a cloud service platform with pay as you go pricing.

You can provision exactly the right type of size of computing resources as per your requirement and access as many
resources as you need, ALMOST INSTANTLY!!

In short, it can be seen as a simple way to access servers, storage, databases, and a set of application services.

Note:

<div class="pl-6">
	AWS owns and maintains the network & hardware required for these application
	services, while you provision and use what you need via a web application.

<div class="text-2xl">Private Cloud:</div>
The cloud services used by a single organisation which is not exposed to the public.
We have complete control over it, and hence have MAXIMUM SECURITY for sensitive application.
Everything is built on Company's Datacenter.
It is generally used to meet specific Business Needs.

e.g. RackSpace

<div class="text-2xl">Public Cloud:</div>
Cloud resources owned and operated by a third party cloud service provider delivered over the internet.
It provides SIX ADVANTAGES OF CLOUD COMPUTING
It is also known as <mark>Cloud Native</mark> or <mark>Cloud First</mark>.

e.g. Azure, Google Cloud, Amazon Web Servics

<div class="text-2xl">Hybrid Cloud:</div>
It is a combination of public and private cloud and is much more complex than
either of two. Keep some servers on-premise and extend some capablities to the cloud.
You have control over sensitive assets in your private infrastructure.

e.g. although not exactly, but Amazon GovCloud is a good example.

<div class="text-2xl">Cross Cloud:</div>
This is a special type of cloud which consists of usage of multiple cloud, and is not 
similar to Hybrid, since there is no "Private Component".

e.g. Amazon EKS \<- <mark>Azure Arc</mark> -> Google Kubernetes Engine , Anthos
