<Section link="aws" title="What is a Cloud Service Provider?"/>
A cloud service provider (CSP) is a company which:
<ul class="list-disc pl-6">
    <li>Provides Multiple Cloud Services for example Compute, Storage,Database,Networking capablities, and much much more!</li>
    <li>These cloud services can be chained together to create a cloud architecture!</li>
    !["service chain"](/content/cloud/aws/service-chain.svg)
    <li>All of these services are accessible via a Unified API.</li>
    <li>These cloud services utilize metered billing based on usage. (miliseconds, seconds, hrs, etc)</li>
    <li>They have righ monitored billing (AWS Cloudtrail)</li>
    <li>They generally have a base Infrastructure As A Service (IAAS) offering on which the whole infrastructure is built upon.</li>
    <li>They offer Automation via Infrastructure as Code (IaC)</li>
</ul>

<Section link="aws" title="What is AWS?"/>
<ul class="list-disc pl-6">
    <li>Launched in 2006</li>
    <li>Simple Queue Service (SQS) was the first AWS Service to be launched for public use in 2006</li>
    <li>Simple Storage Service (S3) was launched in March-2006</li>
    <li>Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) was launched in August-2006</li>
    <li>In November-2010, it was reported that all of amazon.com was migrated to inhouse AWS</li>
</ul>

If a company offers multiple cloud services under a single UI, but does not meet all the above requirements, it would
be referred to as a cloud platform (and not a CSP) Eg. Twilio, HashiCorp, Databricks.
