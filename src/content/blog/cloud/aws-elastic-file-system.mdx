- It is a "shared" managed Network File System (NFS) that can be mounted on hundreds of EC2 instances.
- EFS works with Linux EC2 instances in a multi-AZ.

<br />
<Section link="efs-features" title="Features" />

- High Available
- Scalable
- EXPENSIVE ($$$)
- Pay Per Use
- No Capacity Planning

<Section link="efs-vs-ebs" title="Difference Between EBS & EFS" />
EBS data is not accessible across AZs and Regions(directly, without snapshoting)
while EFS can connect to any EC2 instance across AZs & regions for the same.

<Section link="efs-ia" title="Elastic File System - Infrequent Access (IA)" />-
Storage class that is cost-optimized for files not accessed everyday. - Upto 92%
lower cost as compared to EFS (standard). - EFS will automatically move your
files to EFS-IA based on the last time they were accessed. - We can enable
EFS-IA with a lifecycle policy - E.G. Move files not accessed for 60 days to
EFS-IA - Transparent to the application accessing EFS (i.e. the app will not
need to know if the data is stored in EFS or EFS-IA)
