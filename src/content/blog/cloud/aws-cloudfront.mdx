# CloudFront
```
- Global Edge Network
- Files are cached for a TimeToLive (TTL) [eg. Maybe a day]
- Great for static content that must be available everywhere.
```
# S3 Cross Region Replication
```
- Must be setup for each region, you want replication to happen
- Files are updated in real-TimeToLive
- Files are read-only
- Great for dynamic content that needs to be available at low latency in few regions.
```
