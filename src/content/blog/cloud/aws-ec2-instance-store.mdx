- We already have EBS volumes which act as network drives with good but limited peformance.
- If you require even higher peformance hardware disis, we can use EC2 instance store. (for BEST I/O Peformance)
- EC2 Instance Stores (Unlike EBS and EFS)lose their stored data if they are stopped (ephemeral)
- Risk of dataloss if hardware failure.
- EC2 instance storage is extremely extremely high peformance/fast as compared to EBS/EFS!!
