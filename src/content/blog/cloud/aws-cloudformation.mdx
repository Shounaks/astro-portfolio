CloudFormation is a declairative way of outlining your AWS infrastructure for any
resources (most of them are supported!).

For example with a cloud example you can say:

- I want a security group
- I want 2 EC2 instances using this security group
- I want an S3 Bucket
- I want a Load Balancer (ELB) in front of these resources.

Then cloudformation creates those things for you in the right order with the exact configuration that you specify!

<br />
<Section link="iac" title="Infrastructure as a code" />

- No resources are manually created, which is excellent for control.
- Changes to infrastructure are reveled through code.

<br />
<Section link="cost" title="Cost" />

- Each resource within your stack is tagged with an identifier so you can easily see how much a stack costs to you!
- We can easily estimate the cost of your resources using the cloud formation template.
- Saving Strategy: In some enviornment you automate deletion of templates at 5:00pm & recreate at 8:00AM safely.

<br />
<Section link="productivity" title="Productivity" />

- Ability to destroy & recreate an infrastructure on the cloud on the fly.
- Automated generation of diagram for your templates.
- Declarative programming (No need to figure out ordering & orchestration)

<br />
<Section link="wheel" title="Dont re-invent the wheel" />

- Leverage existing templates to the web.
- Leverage the documentation

<br />
<Section link="productivity" title="Productivity" />

- Everything we will see in the course is supported.
- You can use custom resources, for the resources that aren't supported.

- Design IaaC using GUI & Images
- We can see all the resources
- We can see the relationship between components.
