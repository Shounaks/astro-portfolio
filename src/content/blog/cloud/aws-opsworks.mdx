Chef & Puppet help us peform server configurations automatically or via repetative actors.
They work great with either EC2 instances or on-prem VMs.

<mark>AWS OpsWork == Managed Chef & Puppet</mark>

Its an alternative to AWS SSM!
It is only used to provision standard AWS Resources (EC2 Instances, Database, Load Banancer, EBS Volume)

<br />
<mark>
	The Only reason you want to use AWS OpsWork is that you were using Chef &
	Puppet before migrating to the cloud and you want to reuse your Chef & Puppet
	Templates.
