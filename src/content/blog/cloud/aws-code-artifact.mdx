Software packages depends on each other to be build (also called code deplndencies)
& new ones are created. Storing & Retrieving this dependencies is called Artifact
Management. Traditionally you need to setup your own Artifact Management System.
CodeArtifact is a secure & cost effective artifact management for software development.
Works with common dependencies management tools such as:

- Maven
- NPM
- Twine
- nuget
- Gradle
- Yarn
- Pip

and so on.

Developer & codebuild can retrieve dependency straight from code artifact.
