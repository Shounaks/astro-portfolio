Endpoint allows us to connect to AWS Services using a private network instead of the Public WWW network.
<br/>
tldr. 2 private networks or a private network and another Service (S3, DynamoDB) can now talk to each other using VPC Endpoint Gateway.

There are 2 types of endpoints:

- VPC Endpoint Gateway: Connect to <mark>S3 & DynamoDB</mark>
- VPC Endpoint Interface: Connect to <mark>other services</mark>
