- Whitelist/Blacklist IAM Action.
- Applied at OU (Organisational Unit) or Account Level
- DOES NOT APPLY TO MASTER ACCOUNT
- SCP is applied to all the users and roles of the account including ROOT.
- SCP does not affect server linked roles.
- Server linked roles enable other AWS services to integrate with AWS organisations and cannot be restricted by SCPs.
- <mark> SCP MUST have and explicit ALLOW (does not allow anything by default, DENY_ALL by default) </mark>
- Usecase (For Exam) : 
    - Restrict Access to certain Services (for eg. cannot use EMR)
    - Enforce PCI Compliance by Explicitly disabling services.
