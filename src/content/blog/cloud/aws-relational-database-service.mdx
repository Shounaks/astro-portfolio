# Read Replicas:

- Scale the read workload of your DB.
- Can create upto 15 Read Replicas

!["Read Replicas"](/content/cloud/aws/read_replica.svg)
<br />

# Failover Multi-AZ:

- Failover in case of AZ outage (High-Availablity)
- Data is only read/written into the main Database (DO NOT CONFUSE MULTI-AZ WITH WRITE-REPLICAS!!)
- Can only have 1 other AZ as failover.

# Multi-Region Read Replicas:

- Disaster Recovery in case of Region Issues.
- Local Peformance for global reads.
- Replication Costs.
