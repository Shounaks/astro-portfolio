A way to <mark>deploy our application automatically.</mark> It works with EC2 or
On-Prem Servers
<mark>[i.e. It is a Hybrid Service]</mark>

Server & Instances <mark>MUST BE PROVISIONED</mark> and configured ahead of time with the
code deploy agent.

Basically, it allows us to UPGRADE, EC2 instance/on-prem server apps to next version (V1 or V2) from a single interface.

Servers & Infrastructure must be provisioned beforehand (with CodeDeploy Agent)
