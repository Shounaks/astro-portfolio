- In real life, the load on your website and application can change.
- In the cloud, you can create & get rid of servers very quickly.
- The goal of an ASG is to:
  - Scale Out (add EC2 Instances) to match an increasing load
  - Scale In (remove EC2 Instance) to match a decreasing load.
  - Ensure we have a minimum & maximum number of machine running.
  - Automatically register new instances to a load balancer
  - Automatically <mark>Replaces unhealthy instances</mark>!!
- Cost Saving: Only run at an optimal capacity (principal of the cloud)

<Section link="asg-scaling-strategy" title="Scaling Strategies" />
There are 2 types of strategies which we can implement. Manual & Dynamic Scaling
(using ASGs). - Manual Scaling : Update the size of ASG Manually.

| Strategy Name                             | Explaination                                                                                                                                                  |
| :---------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Simple/Step Scaling (AKA Dynamic Scaling) | When CloudWatch Alarm is triggered (example CPU > 70%), then add 2 EC2 Instances.                                                                             |
|                                           | When CloudWatch Alarm is triggered (example CPU < 30%), then remove 1 EC2 Instances.                                                                          |
|                                           |                                                                                                                                                               |
| Target Tracking Scaling                   | "I want the AVERAGE ASG CPU to stay at 40%" (we use CloudWatch's parameters to make decision by <mark> tracking a specific parameters of the target. </mark>) |
|                                           |                                                                                                                                                               |
| Scheduled Scaling                         | <mark>Anticipate scaling</mark> based on known usage patterns.                                                                                                |
|                                           |                                                                                                                                                               |
| Predictive Scaling                        | <mark>Using ML</mark> to predict future traffic ahead of time.                                                                                                |
|                                           | Automatically provision the right amount of EC2 instances in advance.                                                                                         |
