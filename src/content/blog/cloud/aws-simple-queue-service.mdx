Lets say we have a website hosted on webservers, and it provides a video processing service. The 2nd set og ASG EC2, will be reading
from the SQS queue and processing data. The webservers act as producers and put data into SQS Queue while Video Processing Servers act
as consumers. The Awesome thing about it is that we can scale the second ASG independently from the first (& thats why its called coupling)

<mark>And on top of it, AutoScaling can happen on how many messages there are in the SQS!!</mark>

As its name suggests, FIFO preserves the order of items coming in the queue, unlike normal queue. Thats all!
