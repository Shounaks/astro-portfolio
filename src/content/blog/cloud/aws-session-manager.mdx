AWS Systems Manager is a <mark>Hybrid Service</mark> that helps us to manage our
EC2 and on-prem systems at scale. We can also get operational insights about the
state of our infrastructure while using this service. It is most importantly used
for the following features:

```mdx
- <mark> Patching & Automation</mark> : For enhanced compliance
- <mark> Run commands across entire fleet of servers</mark>
- <mark> Store parameter configuration</mark> with <mark>
  	SSM Parameter Store
  </mark>
- It works with linux, windows, macOS, RaspberryPi OS (Raspian)
```

<br />
<Section link="usecase" title="Trivia" />

- We need to install SSM agent onto the system we control.
- It is already installed by default on Amazon Linux AMI & Some Ubunti AMI
- If instance cannot be controlled with SSM, there is probably an issue with SSM Agent.
- Thanks to SSM Agent wecan run commands, patch & configure our servers.

<br />
- Allows you to start a secure shell on your EC2 and op-prem servers.
- No SSH Access, Bastion Hosts or SSH Keys REQUIRED!
- No Port 22 Access Needd (better security)
- Supports Linux, MacOS, Windows
- Sends Session log data to S3 or Cloudwatch Logs

<mark>
	Any time you see a way to patch EC2 instances, or run command across all the
	servers (be it on AWS or private servers) then think of Session Namager
