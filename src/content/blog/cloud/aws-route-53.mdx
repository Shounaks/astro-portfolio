- Route53 is a managed DNS (Domain Name System)
- DNS is a collection of rules & records which helps clients understand how to reach a server through URLs.
- In AWS, the most common records are:
  - `www.google.com` => `12.34.56.78` => <mark> A record (IPv4) </mark>
  - `www.google.com` => `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334` => <mark> AAAA record (IPv6) </mark>
  - `search.google.com` => `www.google.com` => <mark> CNAME (hostname to hostname) </mark>
  - `example.com` => AWS Resource => <mark> ALIAS (Eg. ELB, CloudFront, S3, RDS, etc) </mark>

  And then the address of closest server is sent back!
