A "Batch Job" is a Job with a Start and an
End (Opposed to Continious)!

- AWS Provisions the right amount of compute & memory.
- You submit/schedule batch jobs & AWS batch does the rest.
- Each Batch Job are defined as Docker Images & run on ECS (Elastic Container Service)
- Helpful for optimization & focussing less on infrastructure.
