	<li>It is a Global Service</li>

Here is a good sample policy:

```json
{
    "Id" : "S3-Account-permission",         //Id is optional
    "Version" : "2023-05-17",               //Policy Language Version
    "Statement": [                          // A statement field is mandatory and consists of one or more individual statements
        {
            "Effect" : "Allow",
            "Action" : "ec2:Describe",
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "sid"       : "1",              //Sid is Statement ID and is optional
            "Effect"    : "Allow",          //Effect can be: Allow/Deny
            "Action"    : "elasticloadbalancing:Describe",
            "Resource"  : "*"
        },
        {
            "Effect" : "Allow",
            "Action" : [                    //Action can also be an array
                "cloudwatch:ListMetrics",
                "cloudwatch:GetMetricsStatistics",
                "cloudwatch:Describe*"
            ]
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "sid" : "2",
            "Effect" : "Allow",
            "Principal" : {
                "AWS" : ["arn:aws:iam::123456789012:root"]
            },
            "Action" : [
                "s3:getObject",
                "s3:putObject"
            ],
            "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3::mybucket/*"]
        }
    ]
}
```

Please do not be intimidated by the above monstrosity, you will get used to it once you understad what everything does.

<Section link="iam-mfa" title="IAM - Multifactor Authentication (MFA)" />
User has access to your account & can possibly configure or delete resources in
your AWS account. You want to protect your root account & IAM users. MFA =
Password you know + Security Device you own.

MFA supports the following MFAs:

<ul class="list-disc pl-6">
	<li>Google Authenticator (Phone)</li>
	<li>Authy (any device)</li>
	<li>YubiKey (3rd party physical key)</li>
	<li>Hardware KeyFab Device</li>
	<li>Hardware KeyFab Device for AWS GovCloud - United States (SurePassId)</li>
</ul>

<br />
<Section link="aws-resource-access" title="How can a user access AWS" />
To Access AWS, you have 3 options:
<ul class="list-disc pl-6">
	<li>AWS management console (protected by password + MFA)</li>
	<li>AWS CLI - protected by access keys.</li>
	<li>AWS SDK - for code, protected by access keys.</li>
</ul>

ACCESS_KEYS are generated using AWS Console and User manage their own access keys.

Word of Warning : DO NOT SHARE ACCESS KEYS PLZ.!!
