- Define your cloud infrastructure using a familier language:
- Alternative to CloudFormation (& if you dont like its YAML Format)
- Infrastructure as a Code (IaaC)
- The code is compiled into a CloudFormation Template (JSON/YAML)
- You can therefore deploy infrastructure & application runtime code together

<Section link="advantages" title="Advantages" />

- Great for Lambda Function
- Great for Docker Container in ECS/EKS
