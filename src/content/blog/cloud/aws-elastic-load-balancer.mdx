<br/>
- An ELB is a managed load balancer.
- AWS gurantees that it will be working.
- AWS takes care of upgrades, maintainance, high availablity.
- AWS provides only a few configuration knobs.
- it costs less to setup our own load balancer but it will be a lot more effort on your end (maintainence, integration).
