If you use GraphQL, think of AppSync

- Uses GraphQL, a Mobile Technology from facebook
- Stores & Sync data across Mobile & Web apps in real time.
- Makes use of graph query language
- Client code can be generated automatically
- Integrated with DynamoDB/Lambda
- Offline Data Synchronization (replaces Cognito Sync, whatever that was...)
- Fine Grained Security
- <mark>Note: AWS Amplify can leverage AWS AppSync in the background.</mark>
