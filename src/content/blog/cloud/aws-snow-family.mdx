- There is a scenario where our complete data is on on-premise servers, so in order to migrate it to AWS cloud, simple cable might not be the fastest method.
  So in such case, this requirement is fulfilled by AWS Snow Family.
- Data Migration
- Highly Secure, Portable Device to collect to process data at the edge & Migrate data into & out of AWS.
