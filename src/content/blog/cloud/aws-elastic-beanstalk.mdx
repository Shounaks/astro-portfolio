- Platform as a Service (PaaS)

A Typical Web Application (3-tier) has an ELB and a ASG & a Database (+Cache). This is a standard design.
This Application can be made using 3 ways!

<br />
!["ebs"](/content/cloud/aws/elastic_beanstalk.svg)

<br />- Manually setting up resources (HARDEST!) - Using CloudFormation or
Amazon CDK (Mid Complexity but better to maintain) - Using Amazon Beanstalk
(Simplest!)

- Managing Infrastructure
- Deploying code
- Configuring all Databases, Loadbalancers, exact
- Scaling Concerns
- Most WebApp have same architecture (ALB + ASG)
- All developers want is for their code to run

<br />
Elastic Beanstalk is a sdeveloper centric view of deploying an application on AWS.
It uses all the components we've seen before. (EC2, ASG, ELB, ROS). But its all in
1 view, that's easy to make sense of.
<mark> We still have full control of the configuration!!</mark>

<br />
There are 3 architecture models: - Single Instance Deployment: Good for DEV env.
- LB + ASG: Great for Production & Pre-Production. - ASG Only: Great for non-webApps
in production [other intermediate microservices!]

Elastic Beanstalk suppports many platforms: <mark>Go, Java SE, Java with Tomcat, .NET with windows server, Node JS, PHP, Python, Ruby, Packer Builder</mark>
If not supported you can write custom platforms as well!
