SNS and SQS are "Cloud Native" services & Propriatery from AWS.
Traditional Application runnign from On-Premise may use open protocols such as:
- MQTT
- STOMP
- WSS
- AMQP
- OpenWine

When Migrating to the cloud, instead of re-engineering the applications to use SQS or SNS we can use Amazon MQ.
It is a managed Message Broker Service for :

- Rabbit MQ
- Active MQ

<Section link="mq-drawbacks" title="Drawbacks" />
```markdown
- Amazon MQ doesn't "Scale" as much as SQS or SNS
- Amazon MQ runs on servers, can run in Multi-AZ with FailOvers
- Amazon MQ comes with both:
    - Queue Features (~ SQS)
    - Topic Features (~ SNS)
