<br />

- It is one of the main building blocks of AWS.
- It's advertized as "infinitely scaling" storage.
- Many website use Amazon S3 as a backbone.
- Many AWS service use AWS S3 as an integration as well.
  <br />

```markdown
- Usecase:
  - Backup & Storage
  - Disaster Recovery
  - Archival
  - Hybrid cloud storage
  - Application Hosting
  - Media Hosting
  - Datalake and Big data analysis
  - Software delivery
  - Static Website Hosting
```

<br />

- Object contain your data.
- They are like files.
- an object must consists of:

| Property  | Information                                                                          |
| :-------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Key       | This is the name of the object.                                                      |
|           | It is the full path.                                                                 |
|           | Key is composed of prefix + Object Name:                                             |
|           | E.g. s3://mybucket/my_file.txt                                                       |
|           | E.g. s3://mybucket/myfolder/anotherfolder/myfile.txt                                 |
| Value     | MAX OBJECT SIZE: 5TB                                                                 |
|           | Object values are the contents of the body, it is just stored as a sequence of bytes |
|           | If upload more than 5GB, must use "must-part" upload                                 |
| VersionId | When versioning is available, its the version identifier.                            |
| MetaData  | Additional information attached to object.                                           |
|           | It is the list of test key-value pairs                                               |
|           | 2 types of metadata: System or User Metadata                                         |
| Tags      | Unicode key-value pair, upto 10                                                      |
|           | Useful security/lifecycle                                                            |

<br />

- S3 allows people to store files/objects in "buckets" (directories)
- Buckets must have a <mark>Globally Unique Name.</mark>
- Buckets are defined at a regional level.
- S3 look's like a global service, BUT, buckets are created in a region.

<br />

| Naming Convension for bucket                  |

<br />

- User Based:
```markdown
AWS S3 has IAM Policies:
Which API should be allowed for a specific user from API
```

- Resource Based:
```markdown
- Bucket Policies: 
  These are bucket wide rules from the S3 console.
- Object Acces Control List (ACL): 
  Finer grain control (can be disabled).
- Bucket Access Control List (ACL): 
  Less Common (can be disabled).
```

Note: An IAM Principal can access an S3 object if the user permission allows it or the resource policy allows its & there is no explicit deny.

- Encryption: Encrypt objects in S3 using Encryption Keys.

<br />

- S3 can host static websites and have them accessible on the internet.
- The website URL will be (dependent on region).
- If you get a 403 error make sure the bucket policy allows public read.
- Note: If you want to host a website, every file related to it should be publicly accessible.

	title="S3 Versioning"
	imageUrl="/content/cloud/aws/icons/Arch_Amazon-Simple-Storage-Service_32.svg"
/>
<br />

- You can version your files in Amazon S3.
- It is enabled at bucket level.
- Files before versioning is enabled will have NULL as their version.
- Different versions of some files will still be available even after versioning is disabled afterwards.

	title="Amazon S3 Replication [Cross Region Replication(CRR) & Same Region Replication (SRR)]"
	imageUrl="/content/cloud/aws/icons/Arch_Amazon-Simple-Storage-Service_32.svg"
/>
<br />

- To use this feature, versioning needs to be enabled.
- Bucket can be in different AWS accounts.
- Copying is Asynchronous
- To copy successfully, it must have proper read & write (to S3) permission in IAM.
- Usecase:
  - CRR - Complicance, Low Latency Access, Replication Across Accounts.
  - SRR - Log Aggregation, Live replication PROD & TEST Accounts.

There are 5 types of storage access provided by S3.

<br />
<Section

<br />
<Section
	link="s3-infrequent-access"
	title="S3 Infrequent Access"

- A special Case:
```markdown
  # Amazon S3 OneZone Infrequent Access
  - High Durablity 99.99999999999% (11 9s Durablity) in a 
  single AZ.
  - Data Loss when AZ is destroyed.
```
